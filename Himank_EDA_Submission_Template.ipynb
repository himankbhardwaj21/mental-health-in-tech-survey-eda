The dataset originates from a survey conducted among professionals working in the technology sector and aims to understand attitudes, awareness, and organizational support related to mental health. Mental health has become a critical factor influencing employee productivity, job satisfaction, and retention, making this analysis highly relevant for modern organizations.\n","\n","The project begins with understanding the structure and nature of the dataset, including its columns, data types, and overall size. Initial exploration involved examining the first few records, identifying numerical and categorical variables, and reviewing statistical summaries for numerical features such as age. This step helped build familiarity with the dataset and guided further analytical decisions.\n","\n","Data wrangling and preprocessing were performed to ensure data quality and reliability. Missing values in categorical variables were handled using meaningful labels instead of removing records, preserving the integrity of the dataset. Duplicate records were removed to avoid biased insights, unrealistic age values were filtered out, and inconsistent gender entries were standardized. These steps ensured the dataset was clean, structured, and ready for analysis, making the notebook production-grade and executable in a single run.\n","\n","The core of the project involved data visualization and storytelling using the UBM framework—Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis. Univariate analysis focused on understanding individual variables such as age distribution, gender composition, mental health treatment status, family history, work interference, remote work adoption, availability of benefits, and wellness program awareness. These visualizations provided foundational insights into workforce demographics and organizational mental health practices.\n","\n","Bivariate analysis explored relationships between pairs of variables, such as family history versus treatment, gender versus treatment, age versus treatment, work interference versus treatment, benefits versus treatment, and willingness to discuss mental health with supervisors and coworkers. These analyses revealed strong relationships between organizational support, openness, and treatment-seeking behavior.\n","\n","Multivariate analysis extended this exploration by examining interactions among three or more variables simultaneously. Relationships between gender, family history, and treatment; age, work interference, and treatment; benefits, care options awareness, and treatment; and remote work, work interference, and treatment were analyzed. These insights highlighted how combined demographic, workplace, and policy-related factors influence mental health outcomes.\n","\n","Overall, the project demonstrates how data-driven insights can help organizations identify gaps in mental health support, improve employee well-being, and design effective workplace policies. The findings emphasize that organizations prioritizing mental health through benefits, awareness, supportive leadership, and flexible work arrangements are more likely to foster a productive, engaged, and resilient workforce."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["https://github.com/himankbhardwaj21/mental-health-in-tech-survey-eda/blob/main/Himank_EDA_Submission_Template.ipynb"],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement -**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Mental health issues among employees in the technology sector are often underreported and insufficiently addressed due to stigma, lack of awareness, and inadequate organizational support.
